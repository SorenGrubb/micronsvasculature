# MICrONS vasculature outline data

Traced vessel centerlines (points + line segments, in minnie65 voxel coordinates) for the [MICrONS → Neuroglancer cell identification tool](https://github.com/SorenGrubb/microns-neuroglancer-tool), split into 10 categories by vessel type and capillary order:

| File | Category |
|---|---|
| `pial_arterioles.json` | Pial arterioles |
| `penetrating_arterioles.json` | Penetrating arterioles |
| `arterial_cap_order1.json` | Arterial capillaries, 1st order |
| `arterial_cap_order2.json` | Arterial capillaries, 2nd order |
| `arterial_cap_order3.json` | Arterial capillaries, 3rd order |
| `venous_cap_order1.json` | Venous capillaries, 1st order |
| `venous_cap_order2.json` | Venous capillaries, 2nd order |
| `venous_cap_order3.json` | Venous capillaries, 3rd order |
| `ascending_venules.json` | Ascending venules |
| `pial_venules.json` | Pial venules |

Each file has the shape:

```json
{
  "name": "Pial arterioles",
  "color": "#c92a2a",
  "nPoints": 22,
  "nLines": 6681,
  "pointsB64": "<base64-encoded little-endian Float32 array, 3 floats per point: x,y,z>",
  "linesB64": "<base64-encoded little-endian Float32 array, 6 floats per line: pointA.x,pointA.y,pointA.z,pointB.x,pointB.y,pointB.z>"
}
```

Coordinates are voxel indices, exactly as they appear in the original Neuroglancer annotation-layer tracings (their own `outputDimensions` transform declares `x`/`y` at 4 nm/voxel and `z` at 40 nm/voxel) — the same convention the main tool uses everywhere else, so no unit conversion is needed when consuming these files. Do not divide by 4/40 again.

This repo exists purely as a lightweight CDN target (via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)) for the main tool, which lazy-fetches only the categories a user toggles on rather than embedding ~52 MB of raw tracing data in the tool itself. Source tracings by Søren Grubb.
